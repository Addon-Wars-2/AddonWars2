### Project status

This project is in early development and does not provide the necessary functionality. But is updated frequently.
The project is driven by .NET 7 and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) using the MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) pattern extensively.

### Motivation

This project is a pet-project which was started to improve the author's practical (yet hobby) skills and create a small, but fully finished and functional application, which could serve well for others.
The development was inspired by a widely known tool [Guild Wars 2 Unofficial Add-On Manager](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/GW2-Addon-Manager), however the decision was made to create a new implementation from scratch rather than improving the existing solution.
